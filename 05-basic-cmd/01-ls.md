ls -l | grep "pattern"    # Filter by pattern
ls -l | sort -k5 -n       # Sort by size numerically

## üí° Pro Tips

### File Information
- `ls -l` shows detailed permissions (rwx), owner, group, size and timestamp
- `ls -li` shows inode numbers (useful for hard links)
- `ls -lh` shows human-readable file sizes

### Filtering & Sorting
- Combine with `grep`: `ls -l | grep "pattern"`
- Sort by size: `ls -lS` (largest first) or `ls -lSr` (smallest first)
- Sort by time: `ls -lt` (newest first) or `ls -ltr` (oldest first)

### Special Indicators
- `ls -F` shows:
  - `/` for directories
  - `*` for executables
  - `@` for symbolic links
  - `=` for sockets
  - `|` for FIFOs

### Hidden Files
- `ls -a` shows all files including hidden ones (starting with .)
- `ls -A` shows hidden files except . and ..
