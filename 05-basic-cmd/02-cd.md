## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction
The `cd` (change directory) command is one of the most fundamental and frequently used commands in Linux. This cheat sheet provides comprehensive guidance for both beginners and experienced users, covering basic to advanced usage scenarios.

## üöÄ Basic Usage
```bash
cd          # Change to home directory (~/)
cd ~        # Same as cd (returns to home directory)
cd /path    # Change to absolute path (e.g., /usr/local/bin)
cd dir      # Change to relative directory (must exist in current directory)
cd ..       # Move up one directory level
cd -        # Switch to previous directory (toggles between two locations)

# Practical examples:
cd ~/Documents       # Change to user's Documents folder
cd /var/log         # Change to system log directory (requires root)
cd ..               # Move up from current directory
cd ../project/src   # Navigate to sibling directory's subfolder
cd ./config         # Enter config subdirectory (./ is optional)
```

## üí° Pro Tips
### Advanced Navigation
- Chain commands: `cd /var && cd log && cd apache`
- Use environment variables: `cd $HOME/projects`
- Navigate to last argument of previous command: `cd !$`

### Path Completion
- Press `Tab` to auto-complete directory names
- Double `Tab` shows available directories
- `cd D[TAB]` completes to `Downloads/` if unique

### Relative Path Mastery
- `.` represents current directory (useful in scripts)
- `..` represents parent directory
- `../../` moves up multiple levels
- Combine relative paths: `cd ../project/src/main`

### Troubleshooting
- `cd: no such file or directory`: Check spelling and path existence
- Permission denied: Verify directory permissions with `ls -ld`
- Use `pwd` to confirm current location
- `cd` with no arguments always returns home

  <sub>üìå Remember: 
  - cd only changes directory - use ls to view contents
  - Use tab completion for faster navigation
  - Combine with pushd/popd for directory stack management
